# RTPReader

This program will, in time, be able to track SIP calls in a .pcap file or directly on a network interface.
By tracking port numbers used during various SIP calls, we should then be able to relate rtp traffic to on-going SIP calls.

When rtp traffic can be related to calls, the ability to filter calls by various parameters will be added.
